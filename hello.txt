Hej Eirini :)


==Considerations when adding ansswers:==

-can it be recognised by ASR? (try saying it and see the output) 
    //eliminate hard-to-recognize words...eg 'knee', 'Oman',
-always use singular, lemma form (unless something like 'netherlands')
-should be a common answer (ie not something obscure)
-would be nice if there are other anwser starting with the same letter (so it won't be the only right answer)
-if an answer keeps being recognised as something else, consider adding the latter to answers
    // eg when i say 'cyprus' or 'nanna', it keeps getting recognised as 'cypress' and 'nana'
