==Considerations when adding answers==

1) Can it be recognised by ASR? (try saying it and see the output) 
    //eliminate hard-to-recognize words...eg 'knee', 'Oman',
    //what is the recognised output? eg is it 'post man' or 'postman', 'k pop' or 'k-pop'...etc

2) Always use singular, lemmatised form (unless something like 'Netherlands')

3) It should be a common answer (i.e. not something obscure)

4) It would be nice if there are other answers starting with the same letter (so it won't be the only right answer)

5) If an answer keeps being recognised as something else, consider adding the latter to answers
    // eg when i say 'cyprus' or 'nanna', it keeps getting recognised as 'cypress' and 'nana'
